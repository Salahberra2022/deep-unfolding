## Deep unfolding of iterative method

The package includes iterative methods for solving linear equations. However, due to the various parameters and performance of the iterative approach, it is necessary to optimize these parameters to improve the convergence rate. Such a proposed tool called **deep_unfolding**, which takes an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations T, unravels its structure and adds trainable parameters. These parameters are then trained using deep learning techniques such as loss functions, stochastic gradient descent, and back-propagation.
The package contains two different Iterative methods. The first package is called **Iterative**, which contains the conventional iterative method. The other package is called **IterativeNet**, which contains the deep unfolding of the iterative method.

### Installation

### The diagram of the Deep unfolded network (DUN)

In this example of the diagram, it can show that **$\omega_{l}$** can be unfolded throughout this network and can be the optimum parameter based on the input of the matrix.
